2020 AC has been so far the "stay at home" year. And yes, we all have been locked up. I have been calling food delivery services for finding at least a bit of confort in food. But what have we been eating? Does it explains by itself the ugly numbers that the scale gives me every morning?
  Hard to tell. Here I leave some idea about is knowing what you have being ordering and how refined or easy for the palate
  you've been.
